# Josh L. S. Daeli - Single Page Responsive Portfolio

Here is my indivdual single-page responsive portfolio website built for the HCI Lab Assignment - Week 7 at Binus University

## Overview
The website indicates about my profile, projects, skills, and contact information in a proper, responsive layout.
It was designed in Figma and created using HTML and CSS.

## Purpose
1. To practice how to create the responsive web through its design and tecniques.
2. Learn the structures from the code to support the web quality.

## Target Audience
Employers

## Sections
header (name and tagline), about me, projects, skills, contact, and footer

## Description
My project of the single-page responsive portfolio was completed through two files which are index.html and style.css.
The index.html file comprises the structure and content of the portfolio, including sections of the header, navigation,
about-me, projects, skills, contact, and footer. The style.css file indicates the visual appearance and layout of the site, 
using flexbox, color schemes, responsive media queries, and hover effects to maintain the portfolio looks clean and
professional over all devices.
